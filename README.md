# 🌾 [Meadow Math](https://meadowmath.github.io/)

🌐 Website: https://meadowmath.github.io/

**Meadow Math is a small, interactive math world for children from Pre-K to Grade 5.**

It is built on a simple belief:

> **Children understand math best by doing, not by watching or being told.**

Meadow Math focuses on:

* hands-on interaction over explanation
* visual thinking over text
* curiosity over performance
* calm exploration over pressure

There are no videos to binge and no lessons to rush through.
Each activity is an invitation to *try*, *notice*, and *discover*.

The site is designed as a place:

* where learning feels natural
* where children can move at their own pace
* where understanding grows quietly, like plants in a field

Meadow Math is intentionally simple, static, and handcrafted.
It values clarity, gentleness, and longevity over trends.

## 🌱 How Meadow Math Began

Meadow Math began with my 10-year-old son.

At home, he often watched my wife teach our 4-year-old daughter math. It wasn't formal - sometimes it was counting, sometimes it was drawing, sometimes it was playing math games on the iPad. Math felt less like a subject and more like something you *play with*.

Around the same time, I was talking at home about how AI tools are making it easier for people with very little coding experience to build websites and apps.

One day, my son connected the dots and asked:

> *"Can we make a math game website for kids?"*

That question became Meadow Math.

My wife helped shape the learning approach - thinking through the roadmap, the ideas, and how children actually understand math at different ages. I helped on the technical side, using AI tools and explaining the basics of how websites work (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

My son stayed actively involved throughout, using VS Code and GitHub Copilot to help build the site and learn how ideas turn into real, working software.

We plan to keep adding more games and activities over time, letting the project grow slowly and thoughtfully.

## 🌾 What This Project Is

Meadow Math isn’t a startup or a product to scale quickly.
It’s a family learning project and a quiet experiment.

It’s about exploring:

* how children learn best
* how ideas grow through collaboration
* how technology can support creativity, not rush it

Most of all, it’s about curiosity - both in learning math and in learning how to build something from scratch.

Meadow Math will continue to grow gently, one idea at a time.
